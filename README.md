# Employee Satisfaction Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of an Employee Satisfaction dataset to uncover insights into various factors affecting employee satisfaction and performance. The analysis includes data exploration, histogram visualization, and statistical summaries.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this analysis includes several key metrics such as satisfaction level, last evaluation score, number of projects, average monthly hours, tenure at the company, occurrences of work accidents, and records of promotions in the last five years.

## Key Analyses Performed

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**:
   - Initial inspection of the dataset structure, data types, and basic statistics.
2. **Histogram Visualization**:
   - Generation of histograms to visualize the distribution of key metrics.
3. **Statistical Summary Interpretation**:
   - Detailed interpretation of the summary statistics for each metric.

## Key Findings

- **Satisfaction Level**: The histogram revealed varied levels of employee satisfaction, with notable peaks indicating common satisfaction points. The average satisfaction level suggested moderate contentment among employees, while a notable standard deviation indicated a diverse range of satisfaction levels across the workforce.
- **Last Evaluation**: The distribution of last evaluations suggested a trend towards higher performance scores, with a concentration of scores around the higher end of the scale. The standard deviation reflected a fair degree of variability in these scores.
- **Number of Projects**: Employees were typically assigned a varied number of projects. The most common number of projects was identified, which may reflect standard workload expectations within the company.
- **Average Monthly Hours**: The hours worked per month by employees showed a certain pattern, possibly indicating standard full-time work hours and deviations that might reflect part-time or overtime work trends.
- **Time Spent in Company**: The tenure of employees at the company varied, with some common lengths of stay emerging from the data. This metric could be indicative of employee retention rates and potential turnover.
- **Work Accident**: The occurrence of work accidents was analyzed, providing insight into the safety conditions and frequency of such incidents within the workforce.
- **Promotion in Last 5 Years**: Analysis of promotion data over the last five years offered an understanding of career progression and promotional opportunities within the company. A low average might suggest infrequent promotions.
